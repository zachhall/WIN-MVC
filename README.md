## MVC

Is a Design Pattern
MVC = Model-View-Controller

1. Model: Object that contains data (optionally has logic to update if data changes)
2. View: Represents the visualization of the data the model contains
3. Controller: acts on both the Model and View; controls data flow into the model and updates the view whenever data changes. **Keeps Model and View separate**
